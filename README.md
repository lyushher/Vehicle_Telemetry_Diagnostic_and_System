# Vehicle Telemetry and Diagnostic System Simulator

This project is a Vehicle Telemetry and Diagnostic System Simulator built with Python, 
using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Matplotlib for real-time data visualization.

The main goal of this project is to simulate the basic telemetry and diagnostics functions of a vehicle without requiring a physical car. 
It allows users to accelerate and brake through simple button controls, updating speed and RPM values dynamically on live graphs.

## ðŸš— Key Features:
**Real-Time Simulation:** Speed and RPM values change instantly based on user input (gas and brake buttons).

**User Interface:** Intuitive and responsive GUI built with Tkinter.

**Data Visualization:** Real-time updating speedometer and RPM graphs using Matplotlib.

**Smooth Performance:** Multithreading ensures that the GUI remains responsive during continuous data updates.

**No External Hardware Needed:** All vehicle data is simulated internally, making it perfect for testing and learning purposes.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Motivation:
The goal was to create a realistic simulation environment for vehicle telemetry systems, 
useful for learning about automotive software, real-time data handling, and GUI development. 
This project serves as a foundation for more advanced systems that could include diagnostics, 
error reporting, or external sensor integration in the future.
